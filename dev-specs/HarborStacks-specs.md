### Benefits of This Structure

1. **Modularity**:
   - Each step of the installation process is encapsulated, simplifying maintenance and updates.

2. **Reusability**:
   - Core components (e.g., form generators, progress trackers) can be reused across various parts of the application.

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation of concerns between UI, logic, and API integration ensures easier debugging and enhancements.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Easily add new service configurations or extend features without major architectural changes.

5. **Testing**:
   - Components are testable in isolation, improving the overall quality and reliability.
